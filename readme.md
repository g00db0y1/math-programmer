# 📘 Math-Programmer

An experimental **math programming environment** that combines:

- 📝 **Editor** (React + Monaco) for writing code and math
- 🎨 **Renderer** for LaTeX/Asymptote outputs, including animations
- ⚙️ **API services** for authentication, storage, and premium downloads
- 📦 **Shared packages** (UI components, utilities, configs)

## 🚀 Monorepo Layout

- `apps/` → core applications (editor, renderer, backend API)
- `libs/` → shared libraries (UI, utils, configs)
- `docker/` → container configs for deployment

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend** → React + Tailwind + Monaco Editor
- **Backend** → Node.js + Express
- **Containers** → Docker, orchestrated later with Compose/Kubernetes
- **Workspace management** → Yarn workspaces / Nx
